## Introduction
The Chinese zodiac is a cycle of twelve animal signs that represent different years. The particular animal assigned to a year depends on the lunar year of a person's birth. In this ancient system, each year in a 12-year cycle is associated with a specific animal.

## Historical Background
According to popular folklore, a celestial being once summoned all animals to come and say goodbye before leaving the Earth. In response, only twelve animals appeared: the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. As a reward for their attendance, each animal was bestowed the honor of representing a year in the zodiac, in the order of their arrival.

I used to memorize all zodiac signs using a animation song which was famous among children. Chinese Zodiac Signs are something all Koreans are very familiar with if you are born and raised in Korea. We always check which Zodiac sign is next year and match with individual's Zodiac Sign. For example, all my friend born in the same year have the same Zodiac Sign. I know this doesn't make a person unique (think about all the 4905898989 people who have the same Zodiac Sign in the world!), but it's kind of interesting that I find that the people with the same zodiac sign have share certain charateristics - for example, Tigers tend to be more aggressive (in negative or negative way) than Rabbits (just in general). 

I'd like to create something fun just to remind myself bacis concepts of React.js. It was definitely very FUN! 💖
